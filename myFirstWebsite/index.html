            <p>Hi! My name is Matyas Peterfi. My friends and colleagues call me Mat.
                I'm studying software development and this is my first practice website.</p>
            <p>I enjoy creating complex systems and seeing them work, troubleshooting and mentoring fellow colleagues.
                In my free time I like going on long hikes, riding my motorbike and playing video games.
            </p>

            <li><span class="def-term">Programming Language</span>: A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that 
                can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions 
                for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</li>
